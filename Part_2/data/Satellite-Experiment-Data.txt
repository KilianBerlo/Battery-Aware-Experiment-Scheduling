The L-band and X-band jobs need the satellite to be in a job-specific attitude; if no such job is being executed, the satellite must be in its default attitude. Changing attitude must be performed immediately before and after an L- or X-band job is executed; it requires a slewing time of 10 minutes. In addition to that, prior to slewing into the correct attitude for an L-band job, instruments need to be "preheated" for 20 minutes.

Characteristics of GomX-3:
- Battery capacity: 149760000 mJ
- Background power consumption: 2989 mW
  (includes the continuously active ADS-B job)

Job power consumption:
- UHF:     2630 mW
- X-band: 11945 mW
- L-band:  3863 mW
- Slew:     414 mW
- Preheat:  414 mW

The power provided by solar panels during insolation is attitude-dependent and thus changes depending on the currently active job:
- X-band:    5700 mW
- L-band:    6100 mW
- Otherwise: 5700 mW

You may round the boundaries of the experiment time windows (we recommend to round at least to seconds) and the power consumption values (if necessary for model-checking to terminate in reasonable time or memory); document any rounding in your report.

The Python script convertdata.py converts the CSV data to start stop times in seconds from the reference datetime object called "starttime".
The output can be found in data.txt and can be used in Modest
